## Comparison with Goldblatt
We compared our results with the results which we got from Goldblatt's dataset. 
* 1.	Goldblatt has stated 86% accuracy with Random Forest (10) model using all bands of Landsat 8.
* 2. We calculated accuracy for Goldblatt on the BU/NBU ground truth of five cities which we have created (Delhi, Gurgaon, Chandigarh, Mumbai and Hyderabad). 
Total pixels across all cities were 16,968. The accuracy with Goldblatt dataset came out 89.27%
* 3.	Next, with our dataset, but the same method as used for Goldblatt, accuracy was 92.35%. That means there is 3 percent increase in accuracy only because of our dataset.
* 4.	When we used our dataset with our methodology (min, median and max pixels, three images per year). The accuracy increased to 97.684 percent. 
More than 5 percent increase because of methodology alone.
